Amino acids are the building blocks of all body tissues.\n Protein (from food and supplements) is used to form bones, skin, nails, hair, muscles and cells. Protein also plays a major role in the production of all important enzymes for the body. Eating protein prompts the body to produce amino acids, build muscle, and discourage muscle wasting for long hours. Eating protein leads to increased strength in the gym and faster muscle recovery after exercise.',
